\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have present Waskern, a programmable storage kernel for wide-area
applications.  Waskern is unique in that it enables stateful but serverless
applications.  With Waskern, applications leverage users' commodity cloud storage providers for
persistence, and use a shared self-sovereign identity service for both user and
data authentication.  Using a novel coordination algorithm, Waskern adds a critical piece of
missing functionality--asynchronous user-defined storage processing--that has prevented prior work from
serving as general-purpose storage kernels.

Our code for Waskern is open source, and will be made publicly available.
