\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented Waskern, a programmable storage kernel for wide-area
applications.  Waskern is unique in that enables stateful but serverless
applications by using commodity cloud storage providers for
persistence, and self-sovereign identity services for user and
data authentication.  Using a novel coordination algorithm, Waskern enables
asynchronous, user-defined storage processing--a missing feature from exiting
work that proved critical to the design of these new applications.
The code for Waskern is open source, and will be made publicly available.
